# AI-GENERATED-ART-GAN
AI Generated Art We convert sketch to abstract art using GAN

Follow these steps to execute the code

Step1: Create a shortcut of each of these folders in your drive

abstract art folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15znvQkI6IHrX7vtp4C2M9wwK4fzshs1A?usp=sharing realistic image folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xI_kYC0eR95Hl8d4pnVR7beiJWiwEyLn?usp=sharing sketch folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-3NWcsWYLQF9ino8w4Ns0WwG6pjZBGiI?usp=sharing Trained models: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dd_hJMl-fivFSYV-JV2VQaIbB9aazPRP?usp=sharing

Step 2: Open The Chosen.ipynb file This contains the models that perform the best for converting sketch to realistic image which is followed by its conversion to abstract art.

Step 3: Running this file Make sure that you have downloaded highboost_pix2pix_real.h5 and lapfil_pix2pix_abs.h5 files and entered their path correctly Make sure you have loaded the path of the sample sketch from the sketch folder correctly For comaprison make sure you have loaded the path of the corresponding realistic image from the realistic image folder correctly Now run the code

You will be able to see the sketch input now transform into an abstract art You can also run the other .ipynb files in this repo to see output we got with other gan models by loading their Trained models
